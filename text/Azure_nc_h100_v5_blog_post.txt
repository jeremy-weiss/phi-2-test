Introducing Azure NC H100 v5 VMs for mid-range AI and HPC workloads
Today at Ignite, Microsoft is announcing the public preview of the NC H100 v5 Virtual Machine Series, the latest addition to our portfolio of purpose-built infrastructure for High Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads.
Azure NC H100 v5 VMs are designed to accelerate a broad range of AI and HPC workloads, including: Mid-range AI model training and generative inferencing: Unlike the massively scalable ND-series powered by the same NVIDIA Hopper technology, our NC-series is optimized for training and inferencing AI models that require smaller data size and a smaller number of GPU parallelism. This includes generative AI models such as DALL-E, which creates original images based on text prompt, as well as traditional discriminative AI models such as image classification, object detection, and natural language processing focused on accuracy of prediction rather than the generation of new data.
