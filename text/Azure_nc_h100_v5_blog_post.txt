Introducing Azure NC H100 v5 VMs for mid-range AI and HPC workloads
Today at Ignite, Microsoft is announcing the public preview of the NC H100 v5 Virtual Machine Series, the latest addition to our portfolio of purpose-built infrastructure for High Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads.
The new Azure NC H100 v5 series is powered by NVIDIA Hopper Generation H100 NVL 94GB PCIe Tensor Core GPUs and 4th Gen AMD EPYC™ Genoa processors, delivering powerful performance and flexibility for a wide range of AI and HPC applications.
Azure NC H100 v5 VMs are designed to accelerate a broad range of AI and HPC workloads, including:
Mid-range AI model training and generative inferencing: Unlike the massively scalable ND-series powered by the same NVIDIA Hopper technology, our NC-series is optimized for training and inferencing AI models that require smaller data size and a smaller number of GPU parallelism. This includes generative AI models such as DALL-E, which creates original images based on text prompt, as well as traditional discriminative AI models such as image classification, object detection, and natural language processing focused on accuracy of prediction rather than the generation of new data.
Traditional HPC modelling and simulation workloads: Azure NC H100 v5 VMs are also an ideal platform for running various HPC workloads that require high compute, memory, and GPU offload acceleration. This includes scientific workloads such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), molecular dynamics, quantum chemistry, weather forecasting and climate modeling, and financial analytics.
Azure NC H100 v5 VMs offer the following features and capabilities:
Up to 2x H100 NVL PCIe GPU accelerators: Each H100 NVL PCIe GPU has 94GB of HBM3 memory, providing more than 17% additional memory capacity (per GPU) and almost double the HBM memory bandwidth compared to the prior generation A100 GPUs. The H100 also support PCIe Gen5, providing the highest communication speeds (128GB/s bi-directional) between the host processor and the GPU. Two H100 NVL PCIe GPUs can be combined via NVLink to provide up to 188GB of HBM3 memory, enabling a large level of HBM memory capacity and performance.
4th Gen AMD EPYC™ Genoa processors: Azure NC H100 v5 VMs are powered by the latest AMD EPYC™ Genoa processors, which support PCIe Gen5 and DDR5 memory. The AMD EPYC™ Genoa processors deliver exceptional performance and scalability for both CPU-bound and GPU-bound workloads.
Flexible and modular design: The NC H100 v5 VMs offer two classes of VMs, ranging from one to two NVIDIA H100 94GB PCIe Tensor Core GPUs. This allows customers to choose the optimal VM size and configuration for their specific AI and HPC workloads and achieve the best price/performance ratio.
