Announcing Azure confidential NCC H100 v5 VMs with NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs in Preview
Azure is constantly innovating in security to provide the best protection for its customers' data and applications. One of the innovations that Azure has been pioneering is the enablement of confidential computing. Confidential computing is the protection of data in use by performing computation in hardware-based, attested Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These TEEs prevent unauthorized access or modification of application code and data during use.
While Azure has been leading the enablement of confidential computing on CPUs, there is also a need to enable confidential computing on GPUs. GPUs are widely used for high-performance computing, machine learning, and graphics rendering, which can involve processing large amounts of sensitive data. By enabling confidential computing on GPUs, Azure offers customers more options and flexibility to run their workloads securely and efficiently on the cloud.
NCC H100 v5 VM SKUs support hardware-based TEEs that protect VMs against privileged host components and attackers. With this SKU, GPUs are assigned to the VM in confidential mode. In this mode, the GPU High Bandwidth Memory 3 (HBM3) and security critical configuration registers are isolated and protected against unauthorized access. When the GPU device driver is loaded in the confidential VM, it establishes a secure channel with GPU and uses this channel for all subsequent data transfers between CPU and GPU. Additionally, customers can request attestation to verify that the VMs and GPUs are running a correctly configured TEE before launching sensitive applications and releasing secrets such as data encryption keys. Almost all applications, including those that use NVIDIA CUDA for acceleration, can be transparently executed in these VMs.
